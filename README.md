# 👋 Hey, I'm Aryan

> _“I never wish to be easily defined. I’d rather float over other people’s minds as something strictly fluid and non-perceivable; more like a transparent, paradoxically iridescent creature rather than an actual person.”_

## 🧠 About Me

I’m a Computer Science undergrad at IIITA — someone who codes, builds, thinks, and observes.  
Not loud, not rushing — just quietly weaving logic and intuition together.

I’m drawn to the subtle beauty in systems — whether it's low-level code, physics in motion, or the human stories quietly playing out in the background.

## 🌿 Interests

- Tinkering with **Arduinos** and **Raspberry Pis** to make ideas tangible
- Systems programming with **C/C++**, and light work in **Rust**
- Exploring the edge where **physics** meets the real world
- Thoughtful design — both in tools and interactions

## 🛠 Projects & Explorations

- **Embedded Systems Prototyping**  
  Creating physical devices using Arduinos and Raspberry Pis — where code and circuits collaborate to solve real-world problems.

- **Physics-Based Real-World Devices**  
  Building tools grounded in classical and quantum mechanics — not just to demonstrate theory, but to apply it in ways that matter.

## 💬 Let’s Talk

No big persona, no flash.  
But if you’re creating something with intention — tech, thought, or both — I’d love to listen, learn, or lend a hand.
